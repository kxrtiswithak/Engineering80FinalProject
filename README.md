For our final group project as part of our Java Dev 12-week training course at Sparta Global, we were tasked with the challenge of creating a web-based application to manage feedback discussed in weekly one-to-ones, optimized for mobile phones.    
At the end of each week of training, a trainee would have meeting with their trainer to reflect on their performance over the past week. Prior to this meeting, they are expected to fill out feedback in a spreadsheet, that they will then look over with their, the trainer then adding their comments, this process repeating on a weekly basis. Further details of requirements can be found in the [**`wiki`**](../../wiki/sprints#requirements).
